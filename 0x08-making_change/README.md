# Making_change

Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

- Prototype: `def makeChange(coins, total)`

- Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total

	- If total is 0 or less, return 0
	- If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, `return -1`

- coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
- The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
- You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list
- Your solutionâ€™s runtime will be evaluated in this task

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS` using `python3 (version 3.4.3)`
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A __README.md file__, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the __PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)__
- __All your files must be executable__

```bash
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x08-making_change$ cat 0-main.py
